# Hunger-and-Food-Security

This is for "Hunger and Food Security" team. 

Here is one sample raw data that is part of the Prevalence of Undernourishment index: Original_Joint-Malnutrition-Estimates-by-country-July2020. As for this raw data, we expected to see regional-level data, rather than country-level data. While saving the original dataset, in order to prevent deleting the original data, we will use a back-up document to tidying data. 

Our data set includes both country-level and household-level data. We use World Bank country codes to merge the data. In order to merge information about the same observations, It is important to use the same identification name across multiple data sets. Second, in order to track the source of where the variables come from, we added a label column to the variables. We submitted the data to a reputable DOI-issuing repository like Github for students and others to use. We also included a README file to help readers understand the metadata.
